            About Me
          </h2>
          <p class="indented-p">
            I am a computer science and data science double major at Purdue University graduating in 2026.
            In my free time, I enjoy watching soccer and playing video games.
            I am currently building my programming skills by taking on relevant coursework in data structures and
            algorithms and computer architecture.
            Additionally, I am a teaching assistant for an object-oriented programming class and
            will pivot next semester to helping students learn the C programming language.
          </p>
          <p class="indented-p">
            In the future, I hope to build on my skills through my coursework and interesting outside projects.
            Right now, I am trying to learn graphics programming online through C/C++ and OpenGL.

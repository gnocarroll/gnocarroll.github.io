      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am a computer science and data science double major at Purdue University graduating in 2026.
      In my free time, I enjoy watching soccer and playing video games.
      I am currently building my programming skills by taking on relevant coursework in data structures and
      algorithms and computer architecture.
      Additionally, I am a teaching assistant for an object-oriented programming class and
      will continue next semester helping students learn the C programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, I hope to build on my skills through my coursework and interesting outside projects.
      Right now, I am trying to learn graphics programming online through C/C++ and OpenGL.
